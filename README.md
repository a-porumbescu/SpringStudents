# SpringStudents

This project was designed to familiarize you with Spring Boot. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

This application manages student information and also stores this information in a database. The controller that handles incoming requests from outside has 4 access points:

**GET** to retrieve a student by their email or all students stored in the database at once.

**POST** to store the students in the database.

**PUT** is needed to update the already existing student records.

**DELETE** is used to delete a student by their email.

The application is built on a three-tier architecture: controller, service, repository. It doesn't matter which device the API is used from, as everything is supported.

Two services are also implemented: the first service stores students in the application memory and the second service that stores students in a PostgreSQL database. You can switch between these two implementations using annotations.

This application is a good example of how Spring is able to handle queries: from initial query input, finding the right checkpoint and the right execution method, to going to the database and sending the response to the end user.
